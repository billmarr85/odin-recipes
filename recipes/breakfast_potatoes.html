        <h2>How to: Above Average Breakfast Potatoes</h2>
        <p>I like to throw together a tasty potato hash on Saturday mornings while my toddler son is taking his nap. Then we have breakfast potatoes topped with eggs for brunch! This is relatively simple and quiet, yet still delicious and nice way to make memories.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 to 4 potatoes, whatever kind you have</li>
            <li>1/4 to 1/2 an onion, whatever kind you have</li>
            <li>1/4 to 1/2 of green, yellow, orange, red bell peppers, whatever you have</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsps of olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of coarse kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of lemon pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp of cinnamon sugar mix</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>HOW TO make it</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Let's chop some potatoes: <p>Wash your potatoes and peppers. Fill a large pot with cold water and set it near your chop zone. Grab your favorite knife, mines the trusty cheff knife, and dice the potatoes and throw them in the pot of cold water with a big pinch of salt.</p></li>
            <li>Let's par cook those spuds: <p>Partially cooking the freshly diced potatoes before frying them will help them fry up better. Place the pot over high heat to bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for 7-10 mins until the potatoes are tender on the outside, but still firm in the middle. Remove from heat, drain the water. Put the potatoes back in the pan, cover and shake up the potatoes until they look fuzzy. The roughed up edges helps make the outsides more crispy.</p></li>
            <li>Let's chop the other stuff: <p>While the potatoes are par cooking, chop the onions and peppers and add to a large covered bowl</p></li>
            <li>Time to put it together: <p>Dump the potatoes into the covered bowl with the onions and peppers. Sprinkle the onions and potatoes with the salt, garlic salt, lemon pepper, and cinnamon sugar mix. Drizzle the mixture with the olive oil. Cover with the lid and shake shake shake until the spices and oil are spread throughout the potatoes, onions, and peppers.</p></li>
            <li>it's cooking time: <p>I like to use an air fryer for this step, but you could do it in a cast iron skillet with some oil in the bottom. Preheat the air fryer at 400 degrees for 3 mins. Add all the good stuff from the bowl. Let them cook in the air fryer for 15 to 20 mins shaking periodically to help everything cook more evenly. When they are the desired crispiness, remove from the air fryer, and serve in a bowl with some cheese, a couple fried eggs, and some diced tomatoes. Pop the yolks and drizzle some Valentina's hot sauce in there.</p></li>
