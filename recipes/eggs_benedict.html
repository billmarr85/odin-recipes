        <ul>
            <li>8 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>8 pieces of English muffin sized ham, thinly-ish sliced</li>
            <li>4 English muffins, split</li>
            <li>2 tbsps butter, softened</li>
            <li>Some chives, sliced</li>
            <li>Some paprika, regular, smoked, or other variety</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>HOW TO make it</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Let's get ready: <p>Set the oven to warm, maybe 200 degrees, tops. Brown the ham slices in a skillet and set aside in the warm oven. Toast the English muffins and set aside in the warm oven.</p></li>
            <li>Let's make the Hollandaise: <p>Whisk the egg yolks, lemon juice, water, Worcestershire, and pepper in the top of a double boiler (or makeshift DB if you do not have one) over simmering water in the bottom. Add the melted butter, 1 tbsp at a time, while constantly whisking the mixture. If the sauce gets too thick, add a tbsp of water at a time and continue to whisk. Whisk until all of the butter is incorporated. Whisk in the salt and remove from the heat. Cover the sauce to keep warm and set aside.</p></li>
            <li>Let's poach some eggs: <p>Fill a large saucepan, or big pot with about 6 inches of water. Bring to a gentle simmer, some bubbles, but relatively calm at the top. Add the vinegar. Crack an egg into a small bowl or mug, then gently slip the egg into the gently simmering water. Probably best to only have 4 eggs going at a time so you can keep the timing close and not overload the pot. Cook the eggs until the whites are firm and the yolks have thickened, but are not hard: 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Remove the eggs from the water with a slotted spoon or spider and place them on paper towel to remove excess water. Keep warm, but not too warm. Repeat with any remaining eggs.</p></li>
            <li>Eggs Benedict...ASSEMBLE!!!: <P>Plate the English muffin and spread them with butter. Add the ham, followed by the egg, and then spoon the Hollandaise over the egg. Sprinkle on the chives and paprika.</P></li>
            <li>EAT...!</li>
