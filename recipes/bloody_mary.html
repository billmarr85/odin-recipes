    <h2>How to: Bill's Everyday Bloody Mary</h2>
    <p>I like a good bloody, but am too cheap to keep bloody mix in the house. I'm not too cheap, however, to keep spicy V8 (or store brand equivalent) in the house. With just a few more simple ingredients that we keep around, I'm usually prepared to mix up a simple bloody just about any day of the week.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2oz Vodka, your favorite brand or whatever you can find</li>
        <li>6oz V8, or store brand equivalent, spicy preferred</li>
        <li>1 tbsp or so of Lime juice, I use bottled concentrate, but fresh would be better</li>
        <li>8 dashes of Worcestershire sauce, to taste</li>
        <li>8 dashes of Valentina's Extra Hot sauce, or your favorite brand, or whatever you can find, to taste</li>
        <li>8 shakes of celery salt, to taste</li>
        <li>8 shakes of black pepper, ground, to taste</li>
        <li>8 shakes of coarse sea salt, to taste</li>
        <li>2 ice cubes</li>
        <li>1 celery stalk if you have it, otherwise use no garnish, or a bunch of garnish, whatever you want</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>HOW to make it</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pick your receptacle: <p>I <emp>ALWAYS</emp> use a Ball jar for my bloody. It has the measurement markings on the side, which satisfies my OCD and need for consistency. Mix it and drink it all in the same vessel.</p></li>
        <li>Add all the stuff: <p>Start at the top of the list and work your way down: vodka, V8, lime juice, Worcestershire, Valentina's, celery salt, black pepper, sea salt.</p></li>
        <li>Mix it up!: <p>I mix mine with a spoon until the spices are well incorporated, but can be fun to put the lid on the Ball jar and shake shake shake. Do what puts a smile on your face.</p></li>
        <li>The big finish: <p>Add the ice cubes. Garnish if the spirit moves you.</p></li>
        <li>Drink up and have another.</li>
    </ol>
